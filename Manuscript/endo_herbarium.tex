Global climate change involves hetergenous changes in multiple climate drivers \citep{IPCC2012managing}. 
Predicting species' responses to these drivers, whether species will move, adapt, or potentially go extinct is a major goal of basic ecological research and conservation management. 
Across the tree of life, species interact with macro- and microscopic symbionts which impact their growth and performance. 
These biotic interactions likely modulate responses to changing environmental conditions, yet for most species, we do not know whether they will facilitate or hinder movement and adaptation to novel conditions \cite{gilman2010framework}. Predictions incorporating biotic interactions are likely different than those based on single species responses, but empirical assements of these predictions have been limited by the lack of long-term and spatially extensive datasets of biotic interactions.

Natural history collections, which were originally collected to study and preserve taxonomic diversity, present an exciting opportunity to explore long-term changes in ecological interactions across broad spatial scales \citep{meineke2018unrealized}. 
These collections primarily comprise physical specimens of organisms collected along with information about the time and place of collection. 
These natural history collections, built and maintained by the contributions of thousands of scientists, are invaluable time machines. 
The specimens they contain are samples from dynamically changing environmental conditions through time and space.
These specimens can preserve physical legacies of ecological dynamics and species' interactions. 
Recent work using collections has documented changes in phenology \citep{willis2017old, park2019herbarium, berg2019examination}, as well as pollination \citep{pauw2011reconstruction, duan2019century} and changes in negative interactions such as herbivory \citep{meineke2019herbarium}, but to date, focus has been lacking on long-term changges in reciprocally positive interactions, i.e. mutualisms. 

Given that mutualists alter their partner's fitness, they may play an important role in limiting environmental stress, but changing conditions may also disrupt or breakdown the mutualism \citep{aslan2013mutualism}. 
Examples of mutualism disruption as a result of changing climates include phenological mismatches between plants and their pollinators \citep{pauw2011reconstruction}, drought-driven breakdown in seagrass-lucinid mutualisms \citep{de2016drought}, and coral bleaching due to temperature stress \citep{sully2019global}, all of which can have important consequences for habitat and biodiversity maintainence. 
Alternatively, mutualists may facilitate adaptive responses by improving fitness under stressful conditions, such as facultative bacterial symbionts within insects implicated in improving thermal tolerance \citep{truitt2019wolbachia, renoz2019evolutionary}, or fungal symbionts that allow their grass host to persist in more arid edges of its distribution \citep{afkhami2014mutualist}. 
Whether mutualisms breakdown or promote presistence under climate change is unclear, but likely depends on the intimacy and specialization of the interaction, as well as the physiological tolerances of the mutualists\citep{toby2010mutualisms, warren2014mutualism, rafferty2015phenological}. 
Given that climate change is spatially heterogenous, the rate of change may also have a strong influence on when and where we can expect mutualism facilitation or disruption. 

Early research on \emph{Epichloë} fungal endophytes, symbionts of cool-season grasses, used herbarium specimens to describe the broad taxonomic diversity of hosts \citep{white1985endophyte}. 
These endophytes are vertically-transmitted, growing throughout the aboveground tissue and into the seeds of their hosts, and consequently are preserved along with the plant on herbarium sheets. 
Vertical transmission links the fitness of host and symbiont together meaning that, over time, endophytes that provide fitness benefits should rise in prevalence within the population \citep{fine1975vectors, douglas1998host, rudgers2009fungus}. 
This leads to the prediction that interaction prevalence should generally be high where there are strong fitness benefits, and that prevalence should track changes in environmental drivers that limit fitness. 
Environmental stress is likely particularly consequential at species' range edges where population growth rates are expected to be near replacement levels \cite{}. 
Understanding the ways that endophytes may mediate stress is important for understanding the factors setting species' range limits. 
The interaction prevalence should respond to the fitness effects of the mutualism, and the prevalence of endophytes across the range determines their actual contribution to setting range limits. 
In addition, the rate of environmental change is variable across space across species ranges \citep{IPCC2012managing}, and local changes in endophyte prevalence likely depend on these rates. 
We are taking advantage of the spatial and temporal sampling within herbaria to ask how the prevalence of a widespread mutualistic fungal endophyte symbiosis between Epichloë fungi and grasses has changed in response to changing climate drivers.
Specifically, the objectives of this study are to (i) quantify spatial and temporal change in endophyte prevalence, (ii) identify climate drivers that can explain changes in prevalence, and (iii) assess how the rate of environmental change influences changes in the prevalence of symbionts.

	
	\section*{Methods}
	
I will quantify the spatial and temporal responses of fungal endophyte symbiosis to environmental conditions by assessing the status of endophyte symbiosis in herbarium specimens. 
In particular, I will collect a small sample of seeds from herbarium specimens of \emph{Agrostis hyemalis} and \emph{Elymus virginicus} from across their distributions, and use microscopy to identify the endophyte status of specimens.
	\subsection*{Second-order heading}
	
	Lorem ipsum nulla facilisi, pace \citet{LemKapEx07}. Etiam semper, orci sit amet facilisis interdum, tellus nunc consequat erat, quis viverra nisi diam ut metus. Pellentesque cursus, sapien malesuada euismod iaculis, mauris purus interdum diam, vel vestibulum justo enim vitae tellus. Nunc interdum lorem sit amet diam volutpat tristique. Quisque pulvinar ac metus commodo lacinia (\citealt{Ing11,Xiao2015}).  
	
	\subsubsection*{Third-order heading}
	
	Usually two or three levels of heading will be all you need. Journal style even permits a fourth level in case you need it.
	
	\paragraph*{Fourth-order heading}
	The quick red fox jumps over the lazy brown dog in this paragraph as well. Donec mauris nibh, volutpat vehicula viverra at, iaculis congue sem. Praesent eget erat rhoncus erat sollicitudin volutpat. 
	
	\begin{equation}
	{ \frac{1}{N_k-1} \sum \limits_{t=1}^{N_k} (M_{tjk} - \bar{M}_{jk})^2}
	\end{equation}
	
	Praesent quis dolor in dolor molestie cursus et ac nisi. Vestibulum ante purus, semper eget est vitae, vehicula ornare nisl. Morbi efficitur euismod enim, nec feugiat tellus cursus eget. Donec mauris nibh, volutpat vehicula viverra at, iaculis congue sem.
	
	\subsection*{Another second-order heading}
	
	As \citet{Xiao2015} argued, phasellus porttitor eros et ante condimentum, eget facilisis orci condimentum. Nulla facilisi. Proin placerat elit blandit, euismod dolor nec, dapibus diam. Mauris posuere malesuada lacus, at elementum lacus auctor eu (fig~\ref{Fig:Jumps}A). 
	
	\section*{Results}
	
	Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet. Aenean pulvinar malesuada commodo (see \citealt{DavisEtAl2011}; table~\ref{Table:Founders}). Sed aliquet mauris odio, in tristique dui egestas a. Etiam eu malesuada quam. Suspendisse tincidunt eu erat sit amet vulputate. Duis at arcu et nisl dictum mattis. Maecenas vel cursus ante. Cras eleifend elit nec velit sollicitudin fermentum in ac mauris. Pellentesque rutrum magna vel elit maximus hendrerit. 
	
	\subsection*{The height of the jump}
	
	Aenean eu pellentesque quam (fig.~\ref{Fig:OkapiHorn}). Nam pellentesque augue eu finibus lacinia. Nullam nec justo vitae odio imperdiet rhoncus vitae vitae quam. Pellentesque porttitor metus et lectus ornare, ac cursus urna efficitur (fig~\ref{Fig:Jumps}B). 
	
	\subsection*{The laziness of the dog}
	
	Example paragraph with embedded references (video~\ref{VideoExample}, fig.~\ref{Fig:AnotherFigure}). 
	If you have deposited data to Dryad, it is advisable to cite them somewhere in the main text (usually in the Methods or Results sections). A sentence like the following will do: All data are available in the Dryad Digital Repository (\citealt{CookEtAl2015}).
	
	\section*{Discussion}
	
are a potentially rich target for study within musuem specimens\citep{}. Practically all specimens will be preserved alongside their microbiome, and while some evidence of these association can be expected to be lost over time due to specimen handling and storage. 

	
	\section*{Conclusion}
	
	Duis pharetra enim at libero cursus, eu commodo mi vestibulum. Nullam eget velit nec lectus viverra sodales. Suspendisse egestas, eros at dictum tincidunt, mi orci laoreet libero, eget rutrum sapien arcu blandit odio.

	\subsection*{Fox--dog encounters through the ages}
	
	The quick red fox jumps over the lazy brown dog. The quick red fox has always jumped over the lazy brown dog. The quick red fox began jumping over the lazy brown dog in the 19th century and has never ceased from so jumping, as we shall see in figure~\ref{Fig:Jumps}. But there can be surprises (figure~\ref{Fig:JumpsOk}).
	
	If the order and location of figures is not otherwise clear, feel free to include explanatory dummy text like this:
	
	[Figure A1 goes here.]
	
	[Figure A2 goes here.]
	
	\subsection*{Further insights}
